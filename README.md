# Naming is a Process Gilded Rose Example

[Arlo Belshee](http://arlobelshee.com) has a [great blog series](http://arlobelshee.com/good-naming-is-a-process-not-a-single-step/) about how naming is a process. Names can be improved in the following steps
* [Missing names to Nonsense names](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-2-missing-to-nonsense/)
* [Nonsense names to Honest names](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-3-nonsense-to-honest/)
* [Honest names to Honest and Complete names](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-4-honest-to-honest-and-complete/)
* [Honest and Complete names to names that Do the Right Thing](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-5-honest-and-complete-to-does-the-right-thing/)
* [Names that Do the Right Thing to names that show Intent](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-6-does-the-right-thing-to-intent/)
* [Names that show Intent to names that form a Domain Abstraction](http://arlobelshee.com/naming-is-a-process-part-7-intent-to-domain-abstraction/)

To improve my naming, I will be walking through the process above in this GitHub repo. I will be using [Emily Bache's Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), since the source code is terribly illegible. I will be moving the source code through each of the naming stages, until it forms a domain abstraction.
