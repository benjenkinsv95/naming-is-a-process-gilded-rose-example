# Naming is a Process Gilded Rose Example

[Arlo Belshee](http://arlobelshee.com) has a [great blog series](http://arlobelshee.com/good-naming-is-a-process-not-a-single-step/) about how naming is a process. Names can be improved in the following steps
* Missing names to Nonsense names
* Nonsense names to Honest names
* Honest names to Honest and Complete names
* Honest and Complete names to names that Do the Right Thing
* Names that Do the Right Thing to names that show Intent
* Names that show Intent to names that form a Domain Abstraction

To improve my naming, I will be walking through the process above in this GitHub repo. I will be using [Emily Bache's Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata), since the source code is that terrible and illegible. I will be moving the source code through each of the naming stages, until it forms a domain abstraction.
